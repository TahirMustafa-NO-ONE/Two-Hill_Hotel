- Fully functional dark mode for a customized user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React** for the frontend.
- **Supabase** for the database and real-time data updates.
- **React Query** for data fetching and caching.
- **React Router** for navigation.
- **React Hook Form** for efficient form handling.
- **Recharts** for data visualization (charts and stats).
- **Styled Components** for styling the UI, including dark mode.
- **Vite** for development environment and build system.

## What I Learned

This project was a deep dive into several advanced React concepts, including:

- **Authentication and Authorization:** Implementing Supabase to securely manage user roles (hotel employees).
- **Real-time Functionality:** Leveraging Supabase's real-time features for dynamic data updates.
- **State Management and Data Fetching:** Using React Query to efficiently manage the app's data flow.
- **Complex UI Patterns:** Implementing reusable patterns like the Compound Component Pattern and Higher-Order Components (HOC) to create more maintainable and scalable code.
- **Responsive and Adaptive Design:** Building a responsive user interface using Styled Components, making sure it works well on different devices and screen sizes.
- **Dark Mode:** Adding dark mode functionality for a personalized user experience.
- **Data Visualization:** Using Recharts to create meaningful visual representations of hotel statistics.
